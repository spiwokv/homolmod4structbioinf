# Homology modelling tutorial for Structural biology

The aim of this tutorial is to train homology modelling. Tomato nuclease will be used as an example.
This structure has been solved experimentally (3SNG, Koval et al. 2013, Acta Crystallogr.,Sect.D 69, 213-226
<doi:10.1107/S0907444912043697>) but for the purpose of this tutorial we will forget it and we will
pretend that it has not been solved. Instead, we will predict it on the basis of *Arabidopsis* nuclease
(4CXP, easy task) or bacterial nuclease (1AK0, more advanced task).
